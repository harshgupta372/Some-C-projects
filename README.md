 ## some C Projects

This repo holds practice projects in C.

1. Best Fantasy Team:

This program helps build the best fantasy sports team (cricket) based on user input. Users provide player information (stats, positions, etc.), and the program recommends an optimal 11-player team.

2. Fielding Optimization Tool:

This program assists in optimizing fielding positions for a cricket team. Users might provide player skills or situational factors, and the program suggests the most effective fielding configuration.

3. DLS Method in Cricket:
   
This program simulates the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) method used in rain-affected cricket matches. Users might provide target scores and overs bowled, and the program calculates the revised target based on DLS regulations.

4.  Batter Reaction Time Analysis:

This program estimates a batter's reaction time based on the speed of the bowled cricket ball (user input). It considers factors like the distance between bowler and batter.

5.  Dictatorship (Game):

This interactive game simulates a dictatorship. Users (citizens) must follow the dictator's rules (prompts) or face consequences (messages).

6. Unit Converter:

This program converts units between Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), meters (m), feet (ft), grams (g), and kilograms (kg) based on user input.

7. Mad Libs Generator:

This interactive game prompts users for words, and the program inserts them into a story template for a humorous result.

8. DRS system :

This code simulates the Decision Review System (DRS) used in cricket for LBW (Leg Before Wicket) decisions. It considers factors like ball trajectory, pitch conditions, and umpire bias.

Features:
~ Ball Tracking: Simulates the ball's path based on initial position, speed, and gravity.
~ Pitch Conditions: Models variations in bounce and movement due to "flat," "bumpy," "swing," or "turning" pitches.
~ Umpire Bias: Simulates a random chance for an umpire's call, with an optional bias factor.
